# Architect

Architect helps enforce architectural decisions in your PHP projects. 

For example you can enforce that the `src/` folder does not use the `test/` folder,
or you can enforce a layered architecture, where you split up your code in a `Domain`, `Application`, 
and `Infrastructure` layer, where layers can only have dependencies inward.


Architect is currently very much in beta, so any provided feedback is really helpfull.
